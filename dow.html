       <div class="col-6_sm-12">During my time at Dow, I worked as the sole designer in the Systems Development department. My main project was ExposureVision, a web application which let clients have access to a user interface to monitor paint test panels. Dow Coating Materials tracks exterior paint perfomance on more than 30,000 test panels worldwide. I designed the user interface for the app in Adobe Photoshop with an emphasis on how users retrieved data. I was also able to implement some of the pages using front end technologies, such as Durandal, KnockoutJS and jayData. </div>
