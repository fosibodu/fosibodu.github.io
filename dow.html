          <h1 style="text-align: center">My Role</h1>
          <p>I was hired by Dow for a year (2015-16) as the sole user interface designer in the Systems Development department to revamp and modernize a Windows legacy application to a web application.</p>
      
          <h1 style="text-align: center">The Challenge</h1>
          <p>The project, known as ExposureVision, is an application which let clients have access to a user interface to monitor paint test panels. Dow Coating Materials tracks exterior paint performance on more than 30,000 test panels worldwide. The goal of the project was to take an old platform and bring it to the web where both the chemical researchers and the clients can access and create data. I was given Balsamiq wireframes and was tasked with using Adobe Photoshop to create the visual aspect.</p>

      <div>
          <h1 style="text-align: center">The Outcome</h1>
          <p>I delivered jpeg mockups and user stories to the developers. The final designs were minimal, clean and to the point. The goal was to streamline the processes the researchers were used to, but also add more functionality that they couldn't have had with their previous application. This app was designed to help them leave their pen and paper note taking in the past and type them into a database they could share with colleagues and clients.</p>

I designed the user interface for the app in Adobe Photoshop with an emphasis on how users retrieved data. I was also able to implement some of the pages using front end technologies, such as Durandal, KnockoutJS and jayData. </div>
