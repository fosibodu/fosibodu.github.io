        <p> The Daily Illini is the independent school newspaper of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a circulation of about 20,000 during the fall and spring semesters. During my time there, I served as the Photo Editor, Web Editor and a print designer. I also redesigned the DailyIllini.com website.</p>
        <p>During winter of 2014, I took on the challenge of redesigning the website which had been up for a while and the web team thought it was time for a refresh. I introduced a cleaner user interface that gives the reader an easier time finding headlines as well as access to more photo galleries and videos.</p>
