        <p>A concept e-commerce moible app to accompany <a href="http://euniekim.com">Eunie Kim's</a> senior thesis, <a href="http://way-bag.com">Way Bag</a>.</p>
        <p>As a twenty-something growing up in the digital age with smartphones, I have noticed that we as a society have shifted from shopping in stores to the web and now on our mobile phones and tablets. I want to create a functional and effective application which would bring ease to online shopping without the frustration that users tend to feel.</p>
        <p>For this project, I created my mockups in Sketch and worked out my prototype in Origami. I also did some product photography using a Nikon D600.</p>
