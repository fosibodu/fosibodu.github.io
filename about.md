        <p>I'm Folake  and I am interested in all aspects of design, with a focus on user interfaces. I try to keep up to speed with the ever changing research and technologies of web design.

        <p>
        I am studying Human-computer Interaction at DePaul University and working as a User Interface Intern at BMW Technology Corporation. I am currently honing my skills as a visual designer by illustrating and keeping up with design trends. I also play around with 2D animation in After Effects and attempt my New Year's resolution of reading more books.</p>
